Hi,

Welcome to GSA’s Tax Portal. If you are an official Lessor Point of Contact, an account has been automatically created for you as your lease may contain a clause that requires you to submit tax documents annually through GSA’s Real Estate Tax Portal.

If you are not an official Lessor Point of Contact, and signed up on your own, you probably want to submit taxes on behalf of a lessor, Once in the Portal,you can search for a lease and “request access”, that lessor will be notified you want to submit taxes on his/her behalf. You will have to wait until they grant you access for you to submit tax documents.

Please visit the below link to finish setting up your account. Once you click the link, a code will then be emailed to you that you’ll have to enter in.

For Lessors, please allow up to 24 hours for GSA to connect your lease(s) to your account.

Please allow up to 24 hours for GSA to connect your lease(s) to your account.

You can visit ret.gsa.gov if you have any questions.

Thanks,
