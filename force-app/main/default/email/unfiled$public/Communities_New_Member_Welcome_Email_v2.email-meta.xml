Hi GSA Lessor,

Our records indicate you lease space to GSA in at least 1 location. Your lease may contain a clause that requires you to submit tax documents annually through GSA’s Real Estate Tax Portal. As part of an effort to expedite this process, we have created a user account for you within this Portal. Please visit the below link to finish setting up your account. Once you click the link, a code will then be emailed to you that you’ll have to enter in.

Link:  {!Community_Url}
Username:  {!Receiving_User.Username}

Please allow up to 24 hours for GSA to connect your lease(s) to your account.

You can visit ret.gsa.gov if you have any questions.

Thanks,
GSA’s Public Buildings Service Office of Leasing</textOnly>
